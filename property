ignore_casing (Boolean) Whether ignore the casing of the property names in the response body. Defaults to false.

ignore_missing_property (Boolean) Whether ignore not returned properties like credentials in body to suppress plan-diff. Defaults to true. It's recommend to enable this option when some sensitive properties are not returned in response body, instead of setting them in lifecycle.ignore_changes because it will make the sensitive fields unable to update.

ignore_null_property (Boolean) When set to true, the provider will ignore properties whose values are null in the body. These properties will not be included in the request body sent to the API, and the difference will not be shown in the plan output. Defaults to false.
