Add a Network rule to allow connection from Fabric to DocumentSvc API on DEV2

Context:
We’re working on a POC for blob file decryption in Fabric. The approach involves making a RESTful API call to DocumentSvc (currently testing on DEV2).

Current Issue:
We’re receiving a connection error when calling DocumentSvc. This might be due to firewall restrictions.
